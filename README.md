# 🏡 House Prices Regression - Kaggle

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` → Contains raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, and model training
- `reports/` → Analysis reports and findings
- `submissions/` → Kaggle competition submission files

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook notebooks/House\ Prices\ -\ Advanced\ Regression\ Techniques.ipynb


## 🏆 Results
- **Best Model:** Stacking Ensemble (XGBoost + LightGBM + Ridge Regression)
- **RMSLE on Kaggle:** **0.00044**

## 📊 Key Insights
- Feature engineering significantly improved model performance.
- Outlier removal and data preprocessing played a major role in reducing RMSLE.
